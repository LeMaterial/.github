**LeMaterial** is an open-source collaborative project led by Entalpic and Hugging Face ⚛️🤗

LeMaterial aims to simplify and accelerate materials research, making it easier to train ML models, identify novel materials, and explore chemical spaces.

This is made possible by existing datasets owned by Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. Visualizations we are using to showcase our dataset are existing tools from Materials Project.
